<div>
    <p>You wake up and feel the cold metal floor under your body.</p>

    <p>-"Ouch!"</p>

    <p>Seems that you must've hurt your head before and passed out from the trauma.<br/>
        As you regain control you realise that you have no idea where you are, but<br/>
        you seem to be in what looks like a storage room of sorts.<br/>
    </p>
</div>

<p>How you got here is a puzzle, what will you do now?</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="page1.html">Check for a window to look through.</a></li>
    <li><a href="page2.html">Try the door at the end of the storage room.</a></li>
</ul>
