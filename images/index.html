<p>As you wake up you realise that you have no idea where you are.<br/>
    A cold metal floor and only a small amount of light source.<br/>
    How you got here is a puzzle, and the place is creeping you out.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Look out what seems to be the only window.</li>
    <li>Try opening the door in the end of the room.</li>
</ul>
