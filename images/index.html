        <p>You wake up and feel the cold metal floor under your body.</p>
        <p>-"Ouch!"</p>
        <p>Seems that you must've hurt your head before and passed out from the trauma.<br/>
            As you regain control you realise that you have no idea where you are, but<br/>
            you seem to be in what looks like a storage room of sorts.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>How you got here is a puzzle, what will you do now?</p>
